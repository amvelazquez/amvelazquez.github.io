Welcome! My research focuses on the political economy of globalization, particularly how state, market, and society dynamics evolve in developing contexts. I explore how perceptions of sovereignty and identity, corporate behavior, and state actions intersect to shape governance and development outcomes. My work focuses specifically on contentious foreign investments, international agreements, and the governance of multinational firms. Drawing on international and comparative political economy, I highlight the challenges and opportunities posed by globalization—especially in Latin America—and its broader implications for governance and state-society relations in the Global South.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis.
