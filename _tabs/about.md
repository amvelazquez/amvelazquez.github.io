Welcome! My research explores the political economy of globalization, focusing on how state-market-society relations evolve in developing contexts. I examine how public opinion, corporate behavior, and state sovereignty intersect to shape governance and development outcomes. Specifically, I study contentious foreign investments, trade agreements, and the governance of multinational firms, with a regional focus on Latin America. Methodologically, I employ survey experiments, text analysis, and geospatial analysis to explore these questions. By connecting insights from international and comparative political economy to the politics of development and contentious governance, my research sheds light on the challenges of globalization in the Global South and offers broader implications for state-society dynamics worldwide.

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis.
