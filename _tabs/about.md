Welcome! I study the politics of the global economy, focusing on intersections with identity and perceptions of sovereignty. My research examines how globalization and historical inequalities shape public opinion, government policy, and the contested dynamics of economic development. My work bridges international and comparative political economy with a regional focus on Latin America.

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis.
