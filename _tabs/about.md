Welcome! I specialize in international political economy, with a regional focus on Latin America. My research explores how global economic forces like foreign investment, trade, and production networks reshape domestic political life, especially in the Global South.

I study the politics of how countries insert themselves into the global economy: how foreign direct investment affects sovereignty and public opinion; how ethnic minority representation shapes trade protectionism; and how structural transformation from commodity exports to more complex production shifts investment relationships and geopolitical alignments.

My work combines survey experiments, network analysis, and text-based methods to answer questions about globalization, development, and political contestation. Broadly, I aim to understand how global capitalism is lived, resisted, and reshaped in the post-colonial world.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis.
